Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Spot. Spot was a happy dog who loved to play with his ball. One day, Spot's ball rolled into a big yard. Spot was very sad and worried. He didn't know what to do.
Spot's friend, a kind bird named Chirpy, saw what happened. Chirpy flew down and said, "Don't worry, Spot. I will get your ball back." Chirpy was happy and thanked Spot. They played together all day long.
The next day, Spot and Chirpy went to the yard. They saw the ball again. This time, they saw a little girl crying. Spot and Chirpy went to her, and she gave the ball back. The girl was very happy and thanked Spot and Chirpy. From that day on, Spot and Chirpy became best friends and played together every day.<|endoftext|>
