Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Spot. Spot was a happy dog who loved to play with his friends. One day, Spot found a big ball in the yard. He was so happy and wanted to play with it.
Spot decided to share the ball with his friends. He called his friends over and said, "Let's play!" But when his friends came, they all wanted to play with the ball too. This made Spot and his friends very sad. They did not want to share their ball.
Spot had an idea. He said, "Let's split the ball with our hands!" His friends thought it was a great idea. They all worked together and split the ball. Spot and his friends were so happy. They played with the big ball all day long and had lots of fun.<|endoftext|>
