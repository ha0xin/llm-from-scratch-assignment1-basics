Bella hopped to the shiny gem and saw that it was a magic gem! She held on to her mommy, who quickly hopped to the glowing gem. When she saw the glowing gem, all the gems were glowing. Bella had so much fun with her new gem that she had found.
When Bella put the gem on her neck, she continued to hop around the park, looking for more shiny gems and the shiny gem. They were so happy to have fun with the glowing gem. From that day on, Bella was known as the most special gem in the world.<|endoftext|>
