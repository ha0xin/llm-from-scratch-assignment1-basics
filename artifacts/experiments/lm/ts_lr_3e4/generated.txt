Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Spot. Spot loved to play outside. One day, he saw a big, scary sign near his home. Spot jumped into the sign and started to bark.
Spot's friend, a little bird named Chirpy, saw him running towards the sign. Chirpy wanted to help Spot. They looked up at the sign and saw that Spot was not close enough to stop him. Spot felt safe again, but he still missed the sign.
Spot came back with a big surprise for his friend, Bunny. They all laughed and played together for a long time. Spot was happy to have an even better friend to play with. They knew that they had a special day together.<|endoftext|>
