Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Spot. Spot liked to play outside and do things all day long. One day, Spot saw a big box on the floor. He opened it and found a big, soft pillow. Inside the box was a lot of treasure. Spot thought it was funny and wanted to play with it.
Spot ran after the bone, but the key was too big for him. Spot did not know where the box was. He looked everywhere for the key to open the box. Spot was so happy to find the key. He looked around the room, behind the bushes, and behind the door. His little toy was gone, but Spot was happy.
The next day, Spot went to the park. He played with his toy and his toy pistol. Spot saw how happy he was and his new friend. He was a good friend. And from that day on he found his way home.<|endoftext|>
