Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Spot. Spot liked to play outside and find things. One day, he found a big pile of junk. Spot was very happy.
Spot wanted to measure the junk. He thought it would be fun to measure the junk. Spot tried to pull through the junk, but it was too big. He felt sad.
Then, Spot's friend, a little girl named Lily, came to see the junk. She saw the junk and wanted to try too. Lily and Spot played and had fun. They used the junk to measure the junk. They made a big hole, and then they took a long time. They were happy they had a fun day together.<|endoftext|>
