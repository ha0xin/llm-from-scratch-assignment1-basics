Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Spot. Spot was a very sleepy dog. He loved to sleep all day in the sun. One day, Spot found a big red ball in the yard. He picked it up with his mouth and ran to his friend, a little bird named Tweet.
Tweet saw Spot playing with the red ball and said, "Let's play with the red ball!" Spot was happy to play with Tweet, so he and Tweet played with the red ball all day long. They rolled it, and they laughed and had fun.
As the sun began to set, Spot and Tweet were tired. They sat down and sat down under a tree. Spot's owner gave Spot a snack and Tweet told him to wait for the red ball to come in. Spot wagged his tail and barked happily. They both sat by the warm tree and enjoyed their sleep. After they were tired, they sat under the tree and talked about their day. Spot and Tweet were happy they had each other and they knew they would play together again the next day.<|endoftext|>
