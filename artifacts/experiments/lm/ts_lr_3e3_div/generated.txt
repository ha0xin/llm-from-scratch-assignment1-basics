Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Spot. Spot was a very sleepy dog. He loved to run and play all day. One day, he saw a big fire in the park. Spot was scared, but he kept running.
Spot knew he should protect his family. He ran fast and put his paw on the fire. But the fire was too much too fast. Spot knew he needed to find more to help his family.
Spot went to his family and told them what happened. They were very surprised. The family laughed and clapped their hands. Spot knew that he was a strong and happy dog, just like his family had saved him. And they all lived happily ever after.<|endoftext|>
