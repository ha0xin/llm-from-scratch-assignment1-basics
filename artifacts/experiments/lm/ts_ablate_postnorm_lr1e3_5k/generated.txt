Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Spot. Spot was a happy dog who loved to play with his friends. One day, Spot's mom told him that he had to go on a trip. Spot was very excited and wanted to go on a trip.
Spot's mom told him to be careful as they walked to the big park. Spot was so excited to unpack his bag. As they walked down the big hall, Spot saw many new friends there. He saw a big ball, a small cat, and a funny bird. They all wanted to play with the ball.
When they got to the park, they played with the ball. They took turns taking turns and rolling it around. Spot was having so much fun. But soon, Spot saw that his ball was missing. He looked around and found it in the park. He was very happy to find his ball again. Spot and the cat played with the ball all day long. They had a great time together.<|endoftext|>
