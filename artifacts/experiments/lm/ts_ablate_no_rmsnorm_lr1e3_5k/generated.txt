Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Bob. Bob loved to hop all day long. One day, while hopping, he found a big, dry stone. This stone was very pretty, and it had many colors. Bob wanted to show his friends the stone, so he hopped and hopped through the water.
Suddenly, the stone started to shake. It was a magic stone! Bob held on to the stone, and something unexpected happened. The magic stone turned into a big, friendly bear! The bear said, "Thank you for finding me, Bob. Now I can fly again!"
Bob was so happy and played with his new feather all day. From that day on, Bob and his friends played together in the big, dry forest. They had fun, and Bob learned that even when you are sad, you can still have fun with your friends. And from that day on, he and his friends had many more adventures together.<|endoftext|>
