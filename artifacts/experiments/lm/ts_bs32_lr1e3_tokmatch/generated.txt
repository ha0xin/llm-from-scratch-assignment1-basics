Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Spot. Spot was a happy dog who loved to play with his friends. One day, Spot's mom told him that he had to go to the store to buy some food. Spot was a bit scared but he wanted to help his mom.
At the store, Spot saw a big red ball. He picked it up with his mouth and ran to his mom. Spot's mom said, "Don't worry, Spot. We can buy this ball for you." They carried the ball to the store and Spot bought a new ball.
When they got home, Spot played with his new ball for a whole day. He was so happy that he didn't quit being scared anymore. His mom was proud that Spot helped her, and he went back to his mom, ready to help.<|endoftext|>
