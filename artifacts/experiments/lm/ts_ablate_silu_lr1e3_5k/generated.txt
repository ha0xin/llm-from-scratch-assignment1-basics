Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sally. Sally had a toy cat named Buddy. She loved to play with Max in her yard. One day, Sally found a small box in her yard. She did not know what was inside.
Sally asked her dad, "Dad, what is in the box?" Her dad said, "Don't open it, Mia. It is a magic box that can make things happen." But Mia did not listen to her dad. She kept playing with the magic box.
Later, Sally's friend Timmy came over to play. They played with the magic box all day. They played with the magic box and made a wish. When it was time for Tom to go home, Sally said, "Thank you for the magic box, Timmy!" Tom was happy to have a new friend.<|endoftext|>
