Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Spot. Spot was a very obedient dog. He loved to play with his ball. One day, Spot saw a big red ball in the park. He wanted to play with it.
Spot tried to push the ball, but it was still stuck. He felt sad. He wanted to play with the big, orange ball. Spot's mom saw him and came to help. She pushed the ball with her paw and it fell down. Spot was happy and wagged his tail.
Spot learned that it's okay to ask for help when he needs something. He went to find his mom and she had a surprise for him. Spot found his mom's big, soft bed and went to sleep. He was so happy to have his ball back. Spot played with his ball all day long.<|endoftext|>
