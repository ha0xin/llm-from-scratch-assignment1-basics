Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Bob. Bob loved to hop all day long. One day, while hopping, he found a big, dry stone. This stone was very pretty. Bob wanted to put the stone in a special place.
Bob hopped back to his cozy spot under a big tree. He put the shiny stone in the ground and started to dance. The stone was very happy in the big, dry place. But then, a big bird flew down from the sky. The bird saw Bob and thought it was food.
The bird wanted to eat the shiny stone. But the big bird did not want to eat the feather. The bird was scared. So, the big bird ate the shiny stone. The big bird was just hungry. In the end, the big bird put the shiny stone and the shiny stone for Bob. Bob and the big bird became good friends. They played together every day and had lots of fun.<|endoftext|>
